# üå± terraform-multi-env

A robust template for managing multiple environments (dev, staging, prod) in Terraform using workspaces and `.tfvars` for safe, scalable IaC deployments.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Workflow

- Single Terraform codebase supports multiple isolated environments via workspaces.
- Each environment is parameterized with dedicated `.tfvars` files.
- Uses modules for reusable infrastructure logic.

**Workflow**:
1. Select or create a workspace for your environment.
2. Apply the relevant `*.tfvars` file for environment-specific configuration.
3. Remote backend support suggested for state isolation and team safety.
